This project involves implementing two algorithms for solving the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem:

1. **Kruskal's Algorithm**
2. **Prim's Algorithm**

## Requirements

For this project, you are expected to:

-   Upload the following files:
    -   The **program/code** file containing your implementation.
    -   A **user manual** explaining how to use your implementations.
-   Optionally, propose a method to empirically evaluate the performance of these algorithms for extra credit.

## Instructions

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Kruskal's and Prim's Algorithms**  
   Implement both algorithms for solving the MST problem. You are allowed to reference online resources for understanding the algorithms, but **do not copy** code directly.

2. **Code Documentation**  
   Add detailed comments in your code to document your implementations. Comments should:
    - Describe the purpose and functionality of each function or procedure.
    - Explain the algorithm and the data structures used in your implementation.

### User Manual

-   Create a user manual for each algorithm to help users understand and utilize your program.
-   The manual should:
    -   Be similar in structure to Python library documentation (e.g., usage examples, function descriptions).
    -   Include examples and clear instructions on how to run and interpret the output of your implementations.

## Extra Credit (Optional)

Suggest a method for empirically evaluating the performance of your algorithms. This could include:

-   Testing the algorithms on various graph inputs.
-   Comparing their runtime or memory usage.
-   Presenting the results in a clear, visual format (e.g., tables or graphs).
